# Face_Recognition_Attendance_Management_Tracking

This project involves developing an attendance system that uses facial recognition to track students' attendance while they check in to a classroom.

The model detects faces using haarcascade frontal images, trains the sampled data, and performs face recognition using the LBPH Algorithm, which is further integrated with customtkinter and the tkinter framework for Python GUI.

It has real-time face recognition technology that allows you to check in and mark your attendance as present.
